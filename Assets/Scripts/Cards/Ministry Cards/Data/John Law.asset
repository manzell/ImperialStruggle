  flavor: John Law was a Scottish economist and financial expert who is best known
    for his role as a central figure in the development of the French economy in
    the early 18th century. He is often referred to as the father of modern economics
    and is credited with introducing the concept of paper money to France. Law was
    born in Edinburgh in 1671 and died in Venice in 1729. He was a controversial
    figure in his time, and his economic theories and practices were met with both
    praise and criticism.

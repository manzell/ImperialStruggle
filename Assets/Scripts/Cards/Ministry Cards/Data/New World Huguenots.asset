  cardText: Once per turn, during a FR Action Round, place 1 Huguenots marker in
    one FR-flagged Territory in N. America or the Caribbean where there isn't one
    already. A Huguenots marker increases its space's CP cost by 1. It may be flipped
    once per game to reduce the EP cost of a Market in its Region by 1. It is permanently
    removed if its space becomes BR-flagged.

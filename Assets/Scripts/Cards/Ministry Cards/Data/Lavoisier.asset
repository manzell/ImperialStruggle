  flavor: Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier was a French chemist and nobleman who is considered
    to be the father of modern chemistry. He was born in Paris in 1743 and was executed
    by guillotine during the French Revolution in 1794. Lavoisier is best known for
    his pioneering work in the field of chemistry, including his discovery of the
    role of oxygen in combustion and his development of the modern system of chemical
    nomenclature. He was a wealthy landowner and a member of the French Academy of
    Sciences, and he used his wealth and influence to support the study of science.
    Lavoisier was a key figure in the scientific revolution of the 18th century and
    his work continues to be highly regarded by chemists today.

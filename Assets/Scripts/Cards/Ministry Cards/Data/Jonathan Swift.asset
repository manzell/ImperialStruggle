  flavor: Jonathan Swift was an 18th-century Irish writer and satirist. He is best
    known for his novel "Gulliver's Travels", which tells the story of a man who
    travels to different fantasy lands and encounters a variety of strange and wonderful
    creatures. Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1667 and died in 1745. He was
    a brilliant writer who used his talents to expose the flaws and corruption of
    the society he lived in. Many of his works, including "Gulliver's Travels," are
    still widely read and admired today.

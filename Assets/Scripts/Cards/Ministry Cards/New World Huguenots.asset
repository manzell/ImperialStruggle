  cardText: Once per turn, during a FR Action Round, place 1 Huguenots marker in
    one FR-flagged Territory in N. America or the Caribbean where there isn't one
    already. A Huguenots marker increases its space's CP cost by 1. It may be flipped
    once per game to reduce the EP cost of a Market in its Region by 1. It is permanently
    removed if its space becomes BR-flagged.
  flavor: The Huguenots were a group of French Protestants who were members of the
    Reformed Church of France during the 16th and 17th centuries. The term "Huguenot"
    is derived from the Swiss city of Geneva, which was a center of the Reformed
    faith, and it was first used as a pejorative term to describe French Calvinists
    in the 1560s. The Huguenots were a significant minority in France, and they faced
    persecution and discrimination from the Catholic majority. Despite these challenges,
    the Huguenots made important contributions to French society and culture, particularly
    in the areas of art, literature, and science.
